Bash Audio Oscilloscope AudioScope Script.

This is a kids level learning tool for basic, (bash), shell scripting and ultra simple electronics.
As it stands it is an uncalibrated AC coupled Audioscope.

The script contains simple circuits, Arduino Detection for future DC usage.

Sinewave and other tone generators are included and are commented in or out depending upon your requirements.

URLs to photos of the project both present and future releases are also shown.

It is in CygWin guise for the forseeable future and should not present much of a problem for most UNIX flavours.
However it is SSLLOOWW inside CygWin...

The FREQ command, frequency counter, works but is unusable due to slow CygWin speed.
The BURST command, 8 second 1KHz sinewave only works in /dev/dsp mode for CygWin...

There is/are lots to do yet but it is still fully usable as an uncalibrated AudioScope...
